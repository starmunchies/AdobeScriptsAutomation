[Photoshop Layer Extractor Script](https://github.com/starmunchies/AdobeScriptsAutomation/blob/main/photoshop/convert_layers_to_psd.js)

This script automates the process of extracting each non-background layer from an open Photoshop document, creating a new document for each layer, and saving it as a separate PSD file.
